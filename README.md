# Song Recommender System

This project aims at developing a song recommendor system using different recommendor techniques:
1. Popularity Based Model
2. Content Based Filtering
3. Collaborative filtering:
  a. User based Collaborative filtering
  b. Item based Collaborative filtering
4. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

## Hybrid Model
In order to improve the recommendor system accuracy, I have developed a hybrid based model that involves the combination of Content Based Filtering, User based Collaborative filtering and Item based Collaborative filtering together.

## Dataset
I used the Million song dataset provided by Kaggle which was provided for Million song challenge for predicting half history of 11,000 users by training the other half and full listening history of other million users.
